# Bushidash
Bushidash is a simple arcade-y game where dashing is the only way to move and attack. Chain dashes and **rack up combos** to get the highest score possible! **But be careful, mistimed dashes break your combo!**

This is a short attempt to force myself to focus on a single mechanic, and while initially it was for a local gamedev challenge for a day, I expanded it a bit more (Four days: 28Jan-1Feb) to make it more presentable.
Made with Godot 4.3.
